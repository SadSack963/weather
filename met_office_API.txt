Resource: val/wxfcs/all/datatype/capabilities
    Returns the time steps available for the daily or three-hourly UK forecast data feed. You can use this data feed to check that the time step you are interested in is available before querying the relevant web service to get the data.

Resource: val/wxfcs/all/datatype/locationId
    Returns a forecast for the next five days including today. Forecast time steps are either daily (separate day and night), or every three-hours. Updated hourly.

Resource: val/wxobs/all/datatype/locationId
    Returns hourly weather observations for the last 24 hours. Updated hourly.

Location ID: number
    A numbered location ID e.g. Dunkeswell Aerodrome = 3840. The list of location IDs available for a datafeed can be fetched using the sitelist resource for that datafeed.

Location ID: all
    The location all can be used to fetch the data for all locations available in a datafeed. This will significantly increase the size of the returned data. Consider using the time query to restrict the data to a specific time step.
